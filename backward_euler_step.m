%This function computes the value of X at the next time step
%using the Backward Euler approximation
%INPUTS:
%rate_func_in: the function used to compute dXdt. rate_func_in will
%              have the form: dXdt = rate_func_in(t,X) (t is before X)
%t: the value of time at the current step
%XA: the value of X(t)
%h: the time increment for a single step i.e. delta_t = t_{n+1} - t_{n}
%OUTPUTS:
%XB: the approximate value for X(t+h) (the next step)
%    formula depends on the integration method used
%num_evals: A count of the number of times that you called
%           rate_func_in when computing the next step
function [XB,num_evals] = backward_euler_step(rate_func_in,t,XA,h)
